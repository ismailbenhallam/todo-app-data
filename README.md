# todo-app-data

This is my first Python project

## Scripts

I created a few scripts, just to warm up ðŸ˜„ :

 - **export.py**           => Export all TODOs from the DB to a JSON file 
 - **create_todo.py**      => Ask a user for a TODO & save it to the DB
 - **todos_list.py**       => Display a beautiful table on the terminal that list the TODOs by priority
 - **todos_piechart.py**   => Open a new window and Draw a pie chart showing the percentage of *done* and *remaining* TODOS
